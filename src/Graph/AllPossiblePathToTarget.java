/*
*
* Given a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1,
* find all possible paths from node 0 to node n - 1 and return them in any order.

The graph is given as follows:
* graph[i] is a list of all nodes you can visit from node i
*  (i.e., there is a directed edge from node i to node graph[i][j]).



Example 1:


Input: graph = [[1,2],[3],[3],[]]
Output: [[0,1,3],[0,2,3]]
Explanation: There are two paths: 0 -> 1 -> 3 and 0 -> 2 -> 3.
